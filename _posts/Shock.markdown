  In the context of space exploration, understanding the physico-chemical phenomena that dictate the flow around re-entry capsules allows optimal design of aerodynamic shape and heat shield to fulfill the playload and cost budget, key to success of ambitious missions. Figure (a) illustrates the complexity of flow physics around a re-entry capsule, where the space vehicle moves with considerable velocity varying from 7.8 km/s when returning from ISS to more than 12 km/s for interplanetary travels. Due to the acute interaction with the atmosphere, a strong bow shock wave is generated, behind which a massive amount of kinetic energy of free stream is converted into the internal energy of surrounding gas, resulting in intense convective and radiative heating to the space vehicle.

The intermolecular collisions promote energy exchanges between the translational and internal modes; and eventually leads to nonequilibrium chemical reactions including dissociation and ionization, from which some products are strong radiators, taken the N$$_2$$ as an example in Figure (b).

Although considerable progress has been accomplished since the 1950s, large uncertanties still remain in the current models for prediction in engineering. In this work a vibration-specific approach is employed to describe vibrational relaxation and reactive processes in shock-heated air. Two sets of rate coefficients for the Zeldovich reactions of NO formation, derived from quasi-classical trajectory calculations, are compared. Results show that kinetics of the NO formation is sensitive to the details of the adopted rate coefficients. The effect of the adopted kinetic description on the radiative signature of post-shock plasma is also investigated. Comparison to shock-tube absolute intensity measurements has provided indications for improving nonequilibrium flow modeling.
